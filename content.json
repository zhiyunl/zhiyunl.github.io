Stearns People live in the present. They plan for and worry about the future. History, however, is the study of the past. Given all the demands that press in from living in the present and anticipating what is yet to come, why bother with what has been? Given all the desirable and available branches of knowledge, why insist—as most American educational programs do—on a good bit of history? And why urge many students to study even more history than they are required to? Any subject of study needs justification: its advocates must explain why it is worth attention. Most widely accepted subjects—and history is certainly one of them—attract some people who simply like the information and modes of thought involved. But audiences less spontaneously drawn to the subject and more doubtful about why to bother need to know what the purpose is.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"历史文化","slug":"历史文化","permalink":"http://zhiyunl.github.io/tags/历史文化/"},{"name":"托福写作","slug":"托福写作","permalink":"http://zhiyunl.github.io/tags/托福写作/"},{"name":"美文欣赏","slug":"美文欣赏","permalink":"http://zhiyunl.github.io/tags/美文欣赏/"}]},{"title":"虚拟语气 Part One： 非真实条件句中的应用","date":"2018-03-25T15:56:06.000Z","path":"2018/03/25/虚拟语气PartOne_非真实条件句中的应用/","comments":true,"excerpt":"虚拟语气用法总结 Part One: 虚拟语气在非真实条件句中的用法1. 非真实条件句中谓语动词的形式 时态类型 主句谓语形式 条件句的谓语形式 例句 与现在事实相反 would / should / could / might + do 动词过去式 did * be 动词统一用 were* 1.

What the country needs most is wise leadership. 2．当主句的表语是复数名词时,主句的谓语动词通常用复数形式。例如： What we need are good doctors. What was real to him were the details of his life. 但在美国英语中主句的谓语动词也可以用单数形式： Perhaps what is most surprising is the tears. What we getting is old answers to old questions.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"名词性从句","slug":"名词性从句","permalink":"http://zhiyunl.github.io/tags/名词性从句/"},{"name":"主谓一致","slug":"主谓一致","permalink":"http://zhiyunl.github.io/tags/主谓一致/"},{"name":"Grammar","slug":"Grammar","permalink":"http://zhiyunl.github.io/tags/Grammar/"}]},{"title":"Conjunction Usage : Coordinating conj.
